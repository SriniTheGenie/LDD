Creating the virtual machine (Windows)
1) After installation of Mutlipass, reboot your pc
2) Open CMD and run the following command
   multipass networks
3) This command will give a Wi-Fi interface name
4) Then runt the following cmd
    multipass launch --network ##WIFI## --name primary
    ## name stands for the wifi network name from the result of the previous command in point 2
    And we are naming the virtual machine with the name primary.  This is to be in sync withe name in linux and Mac environments as per the course
5) Mean while install Remote Development extension in vscode
6) Once the primary virtual machine is launched, go to cmd and write the following command
7) multipass shell -> This command will make you enter into the ubuntu primary
What are we going to do now?
Edit a file with password protection for connecting vscode and the primary machine through ssh
8) sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
9) The configuration file opens up
    use, 
   :set nu -> to set line numbers
   Goto line 62 and change the kbdinteractiveauthentication from no to yes
10) sudo systemctl daemon-reload
11) sudo service ssh restart to restart ssh service to take in the change that we have made
12) Set password using the following command
    sudo passwd ubuntu
13) make a folder called ldd in the primary machine through mkdir ldd command
14) Now to get the IP address of the machine type in multipass list in the windows powershell while the primary machine is in running state and get the IP.  This will be used to connect the vscode to the virtual machine
    primary
